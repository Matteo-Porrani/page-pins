/*
Set core body defaults

It’s useful for the <body> to fill the viewport, even when empty,
so I do that by setting the min-height to 100vh.
I also like smooth anchor scrolling, so I set scroll-behavior: smooth, too.

I only set two text styles.
I set the line-height to be 1.5 because the default 1.2 just isn’t big enough
to have accessible, readable text.
I also set text-rendering to optimizeSpeed.
Using optimizeLegibility makes your text look nicer,
but can have serious performance issues such as 30 second loading delays,
so I try to avoid that now.
I do sometimes add it to sections of microcopy though.
